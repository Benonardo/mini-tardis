If you're reading this, you've most  likely recently gotten (or are soon to get) your hands on a brand-new Model 82-4 TARDIS, congratulations! In the event that you do not have prior training operating this TARDIS model, it is highly recommended that you read this guide in full before making any attempts at flight.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>While most of this guide will still be applicable if your TARDIS is the expanded Model 82-4T, additional functionality such as inter-temporal targeting and displacement will not be covered.</p> <p></p> <p>If you are currently not in possession of a Model 82-4 TARDIS,  see the Getting Started page for details on how to locate one.</p>"},{"location":"getting_started/","title":"Getting Started","text":"<p>In the event that you get stuck on a new world without your trusty TARDIS,  you may have to locate a new one. Since it is definitely not possible to  construct a Model 82-4 TARDIS using only the resources found on such a world,  you will have to use unconventional means to obtain it.</p>"},{"location":"getting_started/#attracting-a-tardis","title":"Attracting a TARDIS","text":"<p>One thing you are able to make use of is the tendency for trajectories of ships travelling the time vortex to intersect. By constructing a rudimentary vessel to enter the time vortex,  you stand a good chance of being picked up by a stray timeship.  Once inside, it should be trivial for any sufficiently trained individual to safely rematerialize their new TARDIS.</p> <p>Blueprints for a basic vessel capable of entering the time vortex are displayed below,  using materials most likely to be available on any new world.</p>"},{"location":"getting_started/#recipes","title":"Recipes","text":"<p>Start by constructing some base components, including a Makeshift Tardis Engine, Handbrake, and about half a stack of Tardis Plating</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"getting_started/#construction","title":"Construction","text":"<p>Once you've collected these materials, you'll be able to construct your makeshift TARDIS.
